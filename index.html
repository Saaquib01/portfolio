							<h2 class="typing-effect">My life in a NutShell.</h2>
						  </header>
						<p> My life so far has been a journey filled with diverse experiences that have helped me grow both professionally and personally. After completing my graduation in civil engineering, I quickly realized that the job market in my field was saturated, and opportunities were scarce. It was a tough time for me, as I had invested a lot of time and energy into my education, only to find that the path I had chosen was not as promising as I had hoped.
							Despite the challenges, I refused to give up and began exploring other areas such as sales, marketing, and freelancing on Fiverr. It was during this time that I stumbled upon data science, which immediately piqued my interest. Thanks to my prior knowledge in programming and DBMS from my college days, I found myself to be at an advantage when I decided to switch domains.							
							Joining AlmaBetter was a turning point in my career. I worked on several challenging projects, ranging from regression and classification to unsupervised clustering. It was a fantastic learning experience that helped me grow both personally and professionally. I discovered my passion for coding, and I now spend my free time experimenting with new programming languages and projects.							
							As much as I enjoy coding, I'm also an avid gamer who loves playing games with strong storylines. It's a perfect way for me to unwind and recharge after a long day of coding.							
							Overall, I'm grateful for the experiences I've had so far and excited about the future. I'm always on the lookout for new opportunities that can help me grow and contribute to society in meaningfulÂ ways.</p>
